Currently I work as a Test Development Engineer at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us). I was a M.Phil (PhD->M.Phil) student in the CSE department of [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/) from 2018 to 2021. My M.Phil thesis can be accessed here: [Thesis: Duplicate-sensitivity Guided Transformation Synthesis for DBMS Correctness Bug Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03660).
