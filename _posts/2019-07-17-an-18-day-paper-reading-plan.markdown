title: "An 18 days Research Paper Reading Plan"
categories: plan research

## Why I want to make this plan?

Reading research papers is an important daily research activity. Though I read papers regularly on topics related to my specific research problem, I still need to continue reading papers to track the big picture. This helps me to understand the recent trend and get a taste of good research.

## How to complete this plan?

I will read one paper on every weekday (including today), summarize the main idea and put down notes about it. This will last for three weeks, in total 18 weekdays.
